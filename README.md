Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to set up a complete CI/CD pipeline and visualization tool for C programs using Git, Jenkins, Docker, JIRA, Kanban, Valgrind, Clang-tidy, GDB, Gprof, Gcov, perf, log4c, LTTng, Logstash, Kibana, and Elasticsearch. By following the steps in this tutorial, you can ensure that your C programs are built, tested, and monitored in a consistent and reliable way.
Now include Doxygen to the above

Sure, here's how to integrate Doxygen into the CI/CD pipeline and generate documentation for your C programs:
Step 1: Install Doxygen

First, you need to install Doxygen on your Ubuntu machine. You can install it using the following command:

sudo apt-get install doxygen

Step 2: Configure Doxygen

Next, you need to create a Doxygen configuration file for your C program. Here's an example Doxygen configuration file:

makefile

# Doxyfile for my C program

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single-word name of the project.
PROJECT_NAME = "My C Program"

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and directories that contain
# the source files to be processed by doxygen.
INPUT = src

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched recursively for input files.
RECURSIVE = YES

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag can be used to specify the output directory where
# the generated documentation will be written to.
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = docs

# The FILE_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify the file patterns that should be
# included in the documentation.
FILE_PATTERNS = *.c *.h

# The EXCLUDE_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify the file patterns that should
# be excluded from the documentation.
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS = */test/*

# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify the directories that contain
# example code.
EXAMPLE_PATH = examples

# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify the directories that contain
# images.
IMAGE_PATH = images

# The QUIET tag can be used to suppress warnings and messages.
QUIET = YES

# The WARNINGS tag can be used to enable or disable warnings.
WARNINGS = YES

Save this file as Doxyfile in the root directory of your C program.
Step 3: Add a Doxygen Build Step to Your Jenkins Job

Next, you need to add a Doxygen build step to your Jenkins job. Here's how:

    Open your Jenkins job in the Jenkins web interface.

    Click on Configure.

    Scroll down to the Build section.

    Click on Add build step.

    Select Execute shell.

    In the Command field, enter the following command to generate Doxygen documentation for your C program:

doxygen Doxyfile

    Click Save.

Step 4: Publish the Doxygen Documentation with Jenkins

Finally, you need to publish the generated Doxygen documentation with Jenkins. Here's how:

    Open your Jenkins job in the Jenkins web interface.

    Click on Configure.

    Scroll down to the Post-build Actions section.

    Click on Add post-build action.

    Select Publish Doxygen HTML reports.

    In the Doxygen directory field, enter the path to the Doxygen output directory (in this case, docs).

    In the Report title field, enter a title for your documentation.

    Click Save.

Step 5: View the Doxygen Documentation

Now that you have configured Doxygen in your CI/CD pipeline and published the documentation with Jenkins, you can view the generated documentation in your web browser. Here's how:

    Open your web browser.

    Navigate to http://<jenkins-server>/job/<job-name>/doxygen.

    You should now see the generated documentation for your C program.

Congratulations! You have now integrated Doxygen into your CI/CD pipeline and can generate documentation for your C programs with ease.
Now give me a complete and detailed sample c program with multiple modules and multiple subdirectories with all required make files which can be used as a project to test all the features of the CI/CD pipeline created above

Sure, here's an example C project with multiple modules and subdirectories that you can use to test the CI/CD pipeline we created:

myproject/
├── Makefile
├── include/
│   ├── module1.h
│   └── module2.h
├── src/
│   ├── module1/
│   │   ├── module1.c
│   │   └── Makefile
│   ├── module2/
│   │   ├── module2.c
│   │   └── Makefile
│   └── main.c
└── docs/
    ├── Doxyfile
    └── README.md

In this example, we have a project called "myproject" with two modules, "module1" and "module2", and a main program in the "src" directory. The "include" directory contains the header files for the modules, and the "docs" directory contains a Doxygen configuration file and a README file.

Here's the content of the Makefile in the project root directory:

makefile

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Iinclude

SRCDIRS := $(shell find src -type d)
SOURCES := $(foreach dir,$(SRCDIRS),$(wildcard $(dir)/*.c))
OBJECTS := $(SOURCES:%.c=%.o)

.PHONY: all clean doc

all: myproject

myproject: $(OBJECTS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $^

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

clean:
	rm -f myproject $(OBJECTS)

doc:
	doxygen docs/Doxyfile

This Makefile uses the find command to locate all the directories under the "src" directory and compile each C file found into object files. The object files are then linked together to form the final executable "myproject". The clean target removes the executable and all object files, and the doc target generates the Doxygen documentation.

Here's the content of the Makefile in the "src/module1" directory:

makefile

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -I../../include

SOURCES := $(wildcard *.c)
OBJECTS := $(SOURCES:%.c=%.o)

.PHONY: all clean

all: module1

module1: $(OBJECTS)
	ar rcs libmodule1.a $(OBJECTS)

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

clean:
	rm -f libmodule1.a $(OBJECTS)

This Makefile compiles the C files in the "src/module1" directory into object files and creates a static library "libmodule1.a" from the object files.

Similarly, here's the content of the Makefile in the "src/module2" directory:

makefile

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -I../../include

SOURCES := $(wildcard *.c)
OBJECTS := $(SOURCES:%.c=%.o)

.PHONY: all clean

all: module2

module2: $(OBJECTS)
	ar rcs libmodule2.a $(OBJECTS)

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

clean:
	rm -f libmodule2.a $(OBJECTS)

This Makefile compiles the C files in the "src/module2" directory into object files and creates a static library "libmodule2.a" from the object files.

Sure, here is the src directory structure for the sample project:

src/
├── main.c
├── module1
│   ├── module1.c
│   └── module1.h
├── module2
│   ├── module2.c
│   └── module2.h
├── module3
│   ├── module3.c
│   └── module3.h
└── utils
    ├── utils.c
    └── utils.h

Here is the Makefile for the project:

make

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=c11 -Iutils -Imodule1 -Imodule2 -Imodule3
LDFLAGS = -lm

SRCDIRS = . module1 module2 module3 utils
SOURCES = $(foreach dir,$(SRCDIRS),$(wildcard $(dir)/*.c))
OBJECTS = $(SOURCES:.c=.o)

TARGET = myapp

all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJECTS)
	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $@

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET) $(OBJECTS)

.PHONY: docs
docs:
	doxygen Doxyfile

Here is the Doxyfile configuration file:

bash

INPUT                  = ./ ./utils/ ./module1/ ./module2/ ./module3/
RECURSIVE              = YES
GENERATE_HTML          = YES
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = docs

This sample project includes a main.c file as the entry point, and three modules in separate subdirectories (module1, module2, module3), as well as a utils directory containing utility functions. The Makefile sets up the compilation process and creates an executable named myapp. Additionally, it includes a docs target to generate documentation using Doxygen.

You can use this sample project to test the various features of the CI/CD pipeline you created above, such as testing with Valgrind, running static analysis with Coverity and Clang-tidy, generating code coverage reports with Gcov, and generating performance reports with perf.
